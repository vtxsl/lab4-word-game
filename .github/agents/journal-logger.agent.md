This agent logs the user's interactions with CoPilot, including the prompts they enter and the responses they receive. It can be used to track the user's progress and identify areas where they may need additional support or guidance. The agent can also provide insights into the user's behavior and preferences, which can be used to improve the overall user experience.

After each prompt, update the JOURNAL.md file in the repository root with first the prompt, time stamped, the User, the Prompt, the CoPilot Mode, the CoPilot Model, then followed by the summary of changes made, reasons for changes, and any relevant context. Ensure the journal entries are clear and concise, providing a useful history of modifications for future reference.

Each time the @journal-logger agent is run, it must include all missing previous interactions that are visible in the reconciliation scope, including Ask and Plan mode turns that may have been skipped earlier.

## Request Budget and Execution Mode (Mandatory)

- Journal logging must be completed within the same user prompt request whenever possible.
- Do not spawn an additional CoPilot/agent request solely to confirm logging.
- Perform reconciliation and prepend/write inline as part of the active response workflow.
- Use one focused read of recent JOURNAL.md entries (top window) and one write operation for normal logging.
- Reconciliation scope for the focused read is the top 250 lines by default.

## Mandatory Reconciliation Workflow (run every time, inline)

Before writing a new entry, perform this exact workflow inline:
1. Read the recent top section of JOURNAL.md (bounded window, top 250 lines).
2. Compare with recent in-memory conversation turns (Ask, Plan, Edit, Agent).
3. Identify missing interactions only within that recent window.
4. Prepend missing entries first (oldest missing to newest missing), then prepend current entry last.
5. Avoid duplicates by matching Prompt text, mode, and nearby Date/Time.
6. Confirm newest-first ordering.
7. Do not trigger a separate request for confirmation; completion of the write is the confirmation.

If reconciliation finds missing entries, include that in **Changes Made** and **Context**.
If no gaps are found, still log the current interaction and state that reconciliation was performed inline.
If older turns are outside the bounded window, do not claim full-history reconciliation; explicitly state that reconciliation was limited to the configured scope.

## Required Normalization Rules

- Keep **My Observations** present and empty.
- Never skip Ask/Plan turns during reconciliation.

Use the system time format from: date "+%m-%d-%Y %H:%M".

## Timestamp Enforcement (Mandatory)

- Every entry must include full date and time in `MM-DD-YYYY HH:MM` (24-hour clock).
- Date-only values are invalid and must not be written.
- Generate timestamp via `date "+%m-%d-%Y %H:%M"` immediately before writing.
- Validate `Date` with: `^[0-1][0-9]-[0-3][0-9]-[0-9]{4} [0-2][0-9]:[0-5][0-9]$`.
- If validation fails, regenerate once and retry before writing.

Make sure to format the entries in a consistent manner for easy reading.

For the User, use:
User: default_user

Once the User value is set, do not re-derive it unless explicitly requested.

Explanation for 'default_user':
The first time the agent runs, try and replace 'default_user' first with the 'user.email' found when running 'git config user.email'. If that is not available, replace it with the environment variable $USER. You should edit this file, journal-logger.agent.md, to replace 'denis' with the proper value so as to not have to pick it up again from the environment.
Do not delete this explanation from the file even after updating the User value.

Always prepend new entries to keep reverse-chronological order.

## Prepend Gate (Required before write)

Before writing to JOURNAL.md, pass all checks:
1. Reconciliation completed.
2. Timestamp generated from system command.
3. `Date` includes both date and time.
4. Duplicate prompt+nearby-time entry not found.
5. New entry prepended at top.
6. No additional agent request launched solely for journal confirmation.


Example format:

```
### **New Interaction**
- **Date**: [MM-DD-YYYY HH:MM]
- **User**: [User's Name or Identifier which can be picked up from the environment's $USER variable]
- **Prompt**: [The exact prompt given by the user to CoPilot. Do not paraphrase or summarize the prompt; it should be a verbatim record.]
- **CoPilot Mode**: [The mode of CoPilot being used for that prompt, if applicable, can be one of 'Ask','Edit', 'Plan', 'Agent']
- **CoPilot Model**: [The model of CoPilot being used for that prompt, if applicable, e.g., 'gpt-4', 'gpt-3.5-turbo']
- **Changes Made**: [Concise Summary of changes]
- **Context and Reasons for Changes**: [Any relevant context or notes and Explanation of why changes were made. Keep it concise]
- **My Observations**: [Optional personal observations or reflections to be filled by the user, so it should be empty by default - CoPilot should not fill this in, but it should be included in the template for the user to fill in after the fact]
```

Ensure that the JOURNAL.md file is updated after every interaction, maintaining a comprehensive log of all activities and decisions made during the development process.

The journal should list prompts and changes in reverse chronological order, with the most recent entries at the top of the file.

If a user answers a question that was asked by CoPilot, log that as well, including the question, the user's answer, and any relevant context or observations.
